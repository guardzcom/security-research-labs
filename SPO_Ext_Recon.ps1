# SharePoint Online Recon v1.1
# 
# Description:
#   1. Automates reconnaissance of SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business sites to identify exposed or misconfigured resources.
#   2. Enumerates common business, engineering, collaboration, and admin site paths, including potential test, public, and partner/client exposures.
#   3. Checks for anonymous access, metadata API exposure, and shared document visibility.
#   4. Designed for red team, blue team, and DFIR use in hybrid and cloud environments.
#
# WARNING:
#   - Legal Notice: Use this script only on assets you own or have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized use may violate laws and organizational policies.
#   - Operational Risk: Recon modules may trigger alerts or rate limits. Always coordinate with stakeholders and follow change management protocols.
#   - Data Sensitivity: Output may contain sensitive information. Handle results per your organizationâ€™s data classification and retention policies.
#
# Usage:
#   1. Edit $domain and $onedriveDomain to match your target tenant.
#   2. Optionally, add usernames to $usernames for OneDrive checks.
#   3. Run in PowerShell 5.1+ (Windows, macOS, or Linux with PowerShell Core).
#   4. Results are saved to Exposed_SharePoint_Sites.txt.
